# FIT5197 - Statistical Data Modelling
This unit explores the statistical modelling foundations that underlie the analytic aspects of Data Science. Motivated by case studies and working through examples, this unit covers the mathematical and statistical basis with an emphasis on using the techniques in practice. It introduces data collection, sampling and quality. It considers analytic tasks such as statistical hypothesis testing and exploratory versus confirmatory analysis. It presents basic probability distributions, random number generation and simulation as well as estimation methods and effects such as maximum likelihood estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, Bayes theorem, bias versus variance and cross validation. Basic information theory and dependence models such as regression and log-linear models are also presented, as well as the role of general modelling such as inference and decision making, and predictive models.

- Question 1: Probability and Distributions [25/25 Marks]

- Question 2: Conditional probability and Bayes Theorem [10/10 Marks]

- Question 3: Correlation Analysis [15/15 Marks]
Wine Quality data sets contains two files, one for red wine and the other for white wine. Details of two data sets can be found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. Please provide a correlation analysis of two data sets and outline your findings. Please note that result visualisation is needed.
