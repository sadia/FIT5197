# FIT5197 - Statistical Data Modelling
## Final Mark: 73
This unit explores the statistical modelling foundations that underlie the analytic aspects of Data Science. Motivated by case studies and working through examples, this unit covers the mathematical and statistical basis with an emphasis on using the techniques in practice. It introduces data collection, sampling and quality. It considers analytic tasks such as statistical hypothesis testing and exploratory versus confirmatory analysis. It presents basic probability distributions, random number generation and simulation as well as estimation methods and effects such as maximum likelihood estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, Bayes theorem, bias versus variance and cross validation. Basic information theory and dependence models such as regression and log-linear models are also presented, as well as the role of general modelling such as inference and decision making, and predictive models.
